##PCA Review to explore how the GWAS data have principal compenents that do not align appropriate relative the Yoruban data.

#QC6A was the first attempt of the merge, but the hapmap data has variants that appear to have more than three alleles present

#QC6B excludes SNPs that appear to have 3+ alleles present.

#QC6C merges the GAIN and hapmap without SNPs with 3+ alleles.

#QC6D filters the data by genotyping rate and minor allele frequency (`--geno 0.2` ; `--maf 0.05`)
  ##A more stringent filter may need to be applied here so that the GWAS PCs do not extend beyond those of the YRB
#QC6E IBD prunes the data.
