After trying to merge the genotypes from GRU with the SARC consent group, there are 2919 SNPs with the same position, but named differently.
(grep -c same AAnonGAIN_SCZ_start.log
2929)

There are 223,793 heterozygous haploids listed in the .hh file

```{bash}
plink --bfile /home/peter/AA_nonGAIN_SCZ/QCSteps/AAnonGAIN_SCZ_start --list-duplicate-vars --out SamePos

plink --bfile /home/peter/AA_nonGAIN_SCZ/QCSteps/AAnonGAIN_SCZ_start  --exclude /home/peter/AA_nonGAIN_SCZ/QCSteps/QCStep0/SamePos.dupvar --make-bed --out premerge_wGAIN
